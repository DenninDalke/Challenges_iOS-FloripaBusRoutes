FloripaBusRoutes
================

This project was created to run on iOS and it was built with Xcode 6.

I integrated CocoaLumberjack in this project via CocoaPods, but it's not required, only optional.

The business logic of the application was created using Swift, some other utils and helpers classes was developed using Objective C.
